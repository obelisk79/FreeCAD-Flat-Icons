# FreeCAD-Flat-Icons
An icon theme for FreeCAD to be applied with the Icon Themes addon.

## About
This set of icons was inspired by the work a user st_phan, found here: https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?t=46633
Initially I started by taking the most recent file I could find from st_phan and normalizing the icons and updating the colors used to coincide with the well structured [open-color](https://github.com/yeun/open-color) ui palette. Not only is it well documented along with a published open source license, it also offers a wide gamut of coordinated colors for further 'theming' opportunities with stylesheets and sketcher colors. Ultimately I intend to create both light and dark preference pack and icon sets for FreeCAD using this awesome color schema.

## How to use
In order to use the theme, you need to have the "Icon Themes" addon installed. Please follow the addon directions for where to locate the rcc file downloaded from this repository.

## How to contribute
Please review the Icon_Guidelines file for some general rules on how I've developed these icons. It is rather incomplete, however I am available to answer questions and recieve feedback via the [FreeCAD Discord](https://discord.gg/uh85ZRNcfk)

Eventually, I envison the possibility to automate color modifications to these icons to be used with stylized themes by other artists/designers.
